Nocruft
=======

The nocruft HTML editor was born out of frustration with Wysiwyg editors
that create ugly HTML mixing style and structure.
Nocruft produces pure HTML, devoid of any embedded style,
except possibly for a single ＜style＞ element.

Usage
-----
To use nocruft, TO BE COMPLETED.

Promises
--------
Nocruft works with collaborative protocols, allowing simultaneous editing of
documents, a la Google Doc. However, Nocruft is independent of such protocols.

Nocruft can be embedded in any application or web page. It also works in forms.

Nocruft can refer to CSS style either by inserting links in the HTML document
head or by inserting a ＜style＞ tag within the edited text.
